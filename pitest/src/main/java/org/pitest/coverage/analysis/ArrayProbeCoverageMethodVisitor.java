/**
 * Instruments a method adding probes at each line. The strategy requires the
 * compiler to be configured to add line number debug information.
 *
 * Probes are implemented by adding an array to each method. Lines hits are
 * registered by a write to this local array. Each method exit point is then
 * augmented with a call that passes this array to the coverage store class that
 * handles communication of this data back to the parent process on the
 * completion of each test.
 *
 * All methods are wrapped in a try finally block to ensure that coverage data
 * is sent in the event of a runtime exception.
 *
 * Creating a new array on each method entry is not cheap - other coverage
 * systems add a static field used across all methods. We must clear down all
 * coverage history for each test however. Resetting static fields in all loaded
 * classes would be messy to implement - it may or may not be faster than the
 * current approach.
