* Switch to ASM 6.1.1
* #448 Aggregate report based on module (thanks @sarahBuisson)
* #462 Escape test names in coverage xml (thanks @maxgabut) 

### 1.3.2

* #433 - Aggregate reports via maven (thanks @rchargel)
* #438 - Filter tests at method level (thanks @ftrautsch)
* #439 - Primitives return mutator doesn't handle bytes
* #380 - Remove reliance on xstream for improved java 9 support

Note when upgrading that history files generated by previous releases are not compatible with 1.3.2 an above.

428 changes the existing behaviour of the excludedClasses filter. Previously this excluded classes from both being mutated and run as tests which may require changes for some people when upgrading.

As a result of 429 TestNG tests will no longer be automatically detected - the new `testPlugin` parameter must be explicitly set to "testng".

This release also changes a number of internal implementation details, some of which may be of interest/importance to those maintaining tools that
integrate with PIT.

Mutations are now scoped internally as described in [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pitusers/E0-3QZuMYjE](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pitusers/E0-3QZuMYjE)

A new class (org.pitest.mutationtest.tooling.EntryPoint) has been introduced that removes some of the duplication that existed in the various ways of launching mutation analysis. 

### 0.30

* Support for parametrized [Spock](http://code.google.com/p/spock/) tests
* Support for [JUnitParams](http://code.google.com/p/junitparams/) tests
* Fix for #73 - JUnit parameterised tests calling mutee during setup failing during mutation phase

* Ability to override maven options from command line
* Ability to fail a build if it does not achieve a given mutation score
* Performance improvement when tests use @BeforeClass or @AfterClass annotations
* Slightly improved scheduling over multiple threads
* Improved maven multi project support
* Integration with source control for maven users

* Smaller memory footprint for main process

**Known issue** - Fix for #33 may not resolve issue for maven 2 users.

Detection of Groovy code has not yet been tested with Groovy 2 which may generate substantially different
byte code to earlier versions.

### 0.27

* Much prettier reports

**Known issue** - The new member variable mutator may cause errors in synchronized errors. The mutator is
however disabled by default, and the generated errors are correctly handled by PIT.

### 0.25

* TestNG support (experimental)
* Fix for issue where mutations in nested classes not isolated from each other
* Fix for broken classpath isolation for projects using xstream

## Issues

Please consult our [issue management rules](ISSUES.md) before creating or working on issues. 

## Credits

Pitest is mainly the work of [me](https://twitter.com/0hjc) but has benefited from contributions from many others. 

Notable contributions not visible [here](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/graphs/contributors) as they were made before this code was migrated to github include 

* Nicolas Rusconi - Ant Task
* Struan Kerr-Liddell - Improvements to html report
* Stephan Pendorf - Multiple improvments including improved mutators
 
Although PIT does not incorporate any code from the Jumble project (http://jumble.sourceforge.net/), the Jumble codebase was used as a guide when developing some aspects of PIT.

## Other stuff

The codebase is checked up on in a few places that give slower feedback than the github hooks.
