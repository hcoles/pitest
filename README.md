Pitest (aka PIT) is a state of the art mutation testing system for Java and the JVM.

Read all about it at http://pitest.org

## Releases

### 1.4.0-SNAPSHOT

* #445 - Raise minimum supported java version to 8

### 1.3.2

* #433 - Aggregate reports via maven (thanks @rchargel)
* #438 - Filter tests at method level (thanks @ftrautsch)
* #439 - Primitives return mutator doesn't handle bytes
* #380 - Remove reliance on xstream for improved java 9 support
* #414 - Replace xstream history store (thanks @kiftio)

Note when upgrading that history files generated by previous releases are not compatible with 1.3.2 an above.

### 1.3.1

* #434 - XStream security warning

### 1.3.0

* #196 - Raise minimum java version to 7
* #425 - Broaden for-each detection
* #428 - Add `excludedTestClasses` parameter
* #379 - Remove support for mutating static initializers
* #432 - Add export plugin functionality into pitest
* #427 - Better return values mutators
* #429 - Simplify test api

428 changes the existing behaviour of the excludedClasses filter. Previously this excluded classes from both being mutated and run as tests which may require changes for some people when upgrading.

As a result of 429 TestNG tests will no longer be automatically detected - the new `testPlugin` parameter must be explicitly set to "testng".

### 1.2.5

* #407 - SCM goal cannot be run from within module (thanks @sbuisson)
* #256 - Inline style violate Content Security Policy (thanks @kiftio)
* #403 - No css in the html report viewed from jenkins (thanks @kiftio)
* #409 - Mutate based on changes across branched (thanks @sbuisson) 
* #418 - Avoid for loop increments
* #424 - Avoid for each code
* #389 - Widen matching of implicit null checks

### 1.2.4

* #397 - Report reasons maven modules skipped
* #389 - Filter junk getClass null checks in lambdas
* #400 - Update to ASM 6.0

### 1.2.3

* Update to ASM 6 for Java 9 support
* #388 - Mark maven plugin as threadsafe
* #362 - Suppress common equivalent mutant in equals methods

### 1.2.2

* #367 - Static analysis cannot find core classes in some projects

### 1.2.1

* #347 - Avoid autogenerated code (e.g by lombok) anotated with @Generated
* #285 - Avoid compiler generated conditionals in switch on string. (thanks @Kwaq)
* #218 - New "naked receiver" / method chain mutator. (thanks @UrsMetz)
* #354/#356 - New extension point plus changes to reduce cost of random access to bytecode for static analysis
* #353 - Improved static initializer code detection
* #364 - Filter infinite loops via static analysis
* #365 - Configuration system for plugins

(Note #347 will **not** detect `javax.annotaion.Generated` as it has only source retention.) 

### 1.2.0

* #318 - Separate main process code from code sharing client classpath
* #295 - Ignore abstract TestNG tests
* #215 - Automatic selection of target classes for maven

Note - as of this release the maven plugin will automatically determine which classes to mutate instead of assuming that the package names match the group id.

* Much faster line coverage calculation
* Fix for #78 - Error when PowerMockito test stores mock as member

This release also changes a number of internal implementation details, some of which may be of interest/importance to those maintaining tools that
integrate with PIT.

Mutations are now scoped internally as described in [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pitusers/E0-3QZuMYjE](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pitusers/E0-3QZuMYjE)

A new class (org.pitest.mutationtest.tooling.EntryPoint) has been introduced that removes some of the duplication that existed in the various ways of launching mutation analysis. 

### 0.30

* Support for parametrized [Spock](http://code.google.com/p/spock/) tests
* Support for [JUnitParams](http://code.google.com/p/junitparams/) tests
* Fix for #73 - JUnit parameterised tests calling mutee during setup failing during mutation phase
* Fix to #63 - ant task fails when empty options supplied
* Ability to override maven options from command line
* Ability to fail a build if it does not achieve a given mutation score
* Performance improvement when tests use @BeforeClass or @AfterClass annotations
* Slightly improved scheduling over multiple threads
* Improved maven multi project support
* Integration with source control for maven users


### 0.29

* Incremental analysis (--historyInputLocation and --historyOutputLocation)
* Inlined code detection turned on by default
* Quieter loggging by default
* Improved Java 7 support
* Upgrade of ASM from 3.3 to 4
* Fix for concurrency issues during coverage collection
* Fix for #53 - problems with snapshot junit versions
* Fix for #59 - duplicate dependencies set via maven


### 0.28

* Inlined finally block detection (--detectInlinedCode)
* New experimental switch statement mutator (contributed by Chris Rimmer)
* Do not mutate Groovy classes
* Fix for #33 - set user.dir to match surefire
* Fix for #43 - optionally suppress timestamped folders (--timestampedReports=true/false)
* Fix for #44 - concurrent modification exception when gathering coverage
* Fix for #46 - incorrect setting of flags by ant task
* Smaller memory footprint for main process
* Faster coverage gathering for large codebases
* Faster classpath scanning for large codebases
* Support for JUnit 3 suite methods
* Fixes for incorrect detection of JUnit 3 tests

**Known issue** - Fix for #33 may not resolve issue for maven 2 users.

Detection of Groovy code has not yet been tested with Groovy 2 which may generate substantially different
byte code to earlier versions.

### 0.27

* Much prettier reports

* Removed inScopeClasses option - use targetClasses and targetTests instead
* Fix for 100% CPU usage when child JVM crashes

**Upgrading users may need to modify their build due to removal of the inScopeClasses parameter**

* Ant support
* New experimental mutator for member variables 
* Fix for #12 #27 - no longer hangs when code under test launches non daemon threads
* Fix for #26 - now warns when no test library found on classpath
* Fix for #30 - now errors if mutated classes have no line or source debug
* Fix for #32 - now correctly handles of JUnit assumptions 

**Known issue** - The new member variable mutator may cause errors in synchronized errors. The mutator is
however disabled by default, and the generated errors are correctly handled by PIT.

### 0.25

* TestNG support (experimental)
* Fix for issue where mutations in nested classes not isolated from each other
* Fix for broken classpath isolation for projects using xstream

## Credits

Pitest is mainly the work of [me](https://twitter.com/0hjc) but has benefited from contributions from many others. 

Notable contributions not visible [here](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/graphs/contributors) as they were made before this code was migrated to github include 

* Nicolas Rusconi - Ant Task
* Struan Kerr-Liddell - Improvements to html report
* Stephan Pendorf - Multiple improvments including improved mutators
 
Although PIT does not incorporate any code from the Jumble project (http://jumble.sourceforge.net/), the Jumble codebase was used as a guide when developing some aspects of PIT.

## Other stuff

The codebase is checked up on in a few places that give slower feedback than the github hooks.
